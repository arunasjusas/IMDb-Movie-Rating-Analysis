## Project Introduction
This project is designed to scrape movie data from IMDb using `ScrapingIMDb.py`, store it in a PostgreSQL database, and then analyze this data with `AnalysingData.py`,
which offers an interactive experience for generating various graphs based on user selection.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `bs4`, `pandas`, `requests`, `psycopg2`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- PostgreSQL database

## Setup Instructions
1. **Database Setup**: Ensure you have PostgreSQL installed and create a database named `BdIMDb`.
2. **Python Environment Setup**: 
   - Install required Python libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. **Configure Database Connection**: 
   - In both `ScrapingIMDb.py` and `AnalysingData.py`, update the database connection parameters (`db_host`, `db_name`, `db_user`, `db_password`) to match your PostgreSQL setup.

## How to Run the Scripts
1. **Data Scraping**: Run `python ScrapingIMDb.py` to scrape movie data from IMDb and store it in the PostgreSQL database.
2. **Data Analysis**: Run `python AnalysingData.py` and follow the prompts to select and view different graphs based on the IMDb data analysis.

## Script Functionalities
- `ScrapingIMDb.py`: Scrapes IMDb data and stores it in a database. It checks and creates the necessary database table.
- `AnalysingData.py`: Connects to the database to fetch data and offers an interactive interface for users to select from various analysis tasks, displaying corresponding graphs and insights.

## Data Analysis Insights

In this analysis, we explored movie data from IMDb ([source](https://www.imdb.com/list/ls503325184/?st_dt=&mode=detail&page=1&ref_=ttls_vm_dtl&sort=list_order,asc)), focusing on 8 distinct tasks to uncover various trends and patterns in the film industry.

### Task 1: Top 5 Most Popular Genres
Our goal was to identify the most prevalent movie genres. The analysis revealed that "Drama" is the leading genre, accounting for over a thousand movies in the dataset.

### Task 2: Top 5 Most Popular Genres By Votes
This task aimed to determine which genres garnered the most audience engagement, measured by vote count. Consistently, the "Drama" genre emerged as the most interacted-with, potentially owing to its volume of movies.

### Task 6: Voting Tendency By Rating
Investigating IMDb user behavior, we found that ratings predominantly fall between 7 and 8, indicating a general trend in user rating behavior.

### Task 7: Correlation Heatmap Between Movie Rating, Runtime, Release Year And Votes
This task explored potential correlations between a movie's rating, runtime, release year, and vote count. The analysis showed minimal correlation, with some noted between the number of votes and both the movie rating and release year.

## Additional Notes
- Ensure proper database accessibility and correct connection settings in the scripts.
- Adjust scraping parameters in `ScrapingIMDb.py` as needed for specific IMDb data.
- Modify `AnalysingData.py` to add or alter analysis tasks and visualizations.
